# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm thrilled to see you've stumbled upon my GitHub profile! My name is Felipe Passos, and I'm currently a student at the [Apple Developer Academy](https://www.apple.com/br/newsroom/2021/05/coders-designers-and-entrepreneurs-thrive-thanks-to-apple-developer-academy/). I have a passion for mobile development and love to code!

# ðŸ”­ What I do
Currently, I work as a frontend developer at UEX, where I use my skills to build modern and responsive interfaces for web applications using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). Besides that, I'm also studying computer science at [PUCPR](https://www.pucpr.br) to expand my knowledge and skills.

# ðŸŒ± My Journey
I started my journey in development with Delphi, working on an ERP system. Since then, I've gained experience in a variety of software applications and projects. Currently, I work as a frontend developer at [UEX](https://uex.io), where I'm working on [VR AdmissÃ£o](https://www.vr.com.br/institucional-vr/vradmissao-rh.htm), an HCM project for the Human Resources sector. Additionally, at [LF Tecnologia](https://www.lftecnologia.com.br), I developed an app called [Remembeer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.lftecnologia.remembeer), which is focused on the beer community.
